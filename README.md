# Pyrothon â€” ðŸ”¥ United ðŸ”½ Forever

This repository manifests a long-standing idea of combining the two rather similar MTProto

It is meant more as a joke, but let's see if this gets anywhere.

## How can I help?

- [ ] Implement mappers for [friendly methods](https://github.com/autogram/Pyrothon/blob/main/pyrothon/methods.py) and types of both libraries
